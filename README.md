# ComplexFunctionGrapher
A visualization tool for complex functions;


Written in C++ this piece of software includes functions to convert HSL to RGB colors, to manipulate the screen using the mouse, and most importantly it can graph complex functions.
Use your mouse to move around and to zoom, press "T" to cycle through the three different visualization modes:

1) Most direct one, perfect to clearly see the values at a point
2) Applies a mathematical function to the luminosity to enhance how distances change, to easily identify asymptotes and zeros.
3) A less visually appealing version of N.2, but this more clearly shows the boundaries and distances.
